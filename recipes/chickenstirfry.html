        <h2>Description and Directions</h2>

        <p>
        Broccoli and Chicken Stir-Fry, Served with rice.
        </p>
        
        <strong>Step 1</strong>
        <br>
        <br>Stir soy sauce, brown sugar, ginger, and red pepper flakes together
         in a bowl to dissolve sugar into the liquid. Mix water and cornstarch 
         together in a small bowl; stir with a whisk until cornstarch dissolves 
         completely.
        <br>
        <br><strong>Step 2</strong>
        <br>
        <br>Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. Fry chicken and onion in 
        hot oil until the chicken is no longer pink in the center and the onion is
         tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir broccoli with the chicken and onion; saute 
         until the broccoli is hot, about 5 minutes. Push the chicken and vegetables
          mixture to the side of the skillet.
        <br>
        <br><strong>Step 3</strong>
        <br>
        <br>Pour the soy sauce mixture into the vacant part of the skillet. Stir
         the cornstarch slurry into the soy sauce mixture until the color is 
         consistent. Move the chicken and vegetables back into the center to the 
         pan; saute until the sauce thickens and coats the chicken and vegetables,
          about 5 minutes more.
