    <h2>Description and Directions</h2>

    <p>
        Indian Naan. 
        This is an authentic Indian Naan recipe. I have made this many times. 
        It goes well with Indian curry which has a lot of gravy, 
        such as the Butter Chicken.

    <strong>Step 1</strong>
    <br>
    <br>Whisk the warm water with the yeast and sugar until the yeast is dissolved.
     Cover and let stand in a warm place for 10 minutes.
    <br>
    <br><strong>Step 2</strong>
    <br> 
    <br>Sift flour and salt three times into a large bowl add the yeast mixture, 
    half of the ghee and all the yogurt. Mix into a soft dough then knead on a 
    floured surface for about 5 minutes or until dough is smooth and elastic. 
    Place the dough in a large greased bowl, cover and let stand in a warm place 
    for 1 1/2 hours or until the dough is doubled in size .
    <br>
    <br><strong>Step 3</strong>
    <br> 
    <br>Punch down dough then knead for 5 minutes. Divide dough into 6 pieces. Roll
     each piece out into 8 inch round naans.
      
      <br>
      <br><strong>Step 4</strong>
      <br> 
      <br>CCover an oven tray with foil and grease the foil. Brush the naan with a 
      little of the remaining ghee and sprinkle with some of the kalonji. Cook naan
       one at a time under the broiler for about 2 minutes on each side or until 
       puffed and just browned.
