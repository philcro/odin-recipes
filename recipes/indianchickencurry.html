        <h2>Description and Directions</h2>

        <p>
            Indian Chicken Curry (Murgh Kari). 
            This is a really good recipe for spicy Indian chicken curry. 
            It's pretty easy to make and tastes really good!
        </p>
        
        <strong>Step 1</strong>
        <br>
        <br>Sprinkle the chicken breasts with 2 teaspoons salt.
        <br>
        <br><strong>Step 2</strong>
        <br> 
        <br>Heat the oil in a large skillet over high heat; partially cook 
        the chicken in the hot oil in batches until completely browned. 
        Transfer the browned chicken breasts to a plate and set aside.
        <br>
        <br><strong>Step 3</strong>
        <br> 
        <br>Reduce the heat under the skillet to medium-high; add the onion, garlic,
         and ginger to the oil remaining in the skillet and cook and stir until the
          onion turns translucent, about 8 minutes. Stir the curry powder, cumin, 
          turmeric, coriander, cayenne, and 1 tablespoon of water into the onion 
          mixture; allow to heat together for about 1 minute while stirring. Mix 
          the tomatoes, yogurt, 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro, and 1 teaspoon salt 
          into the mixture. Return the chicken breast to the skillet along with any 
          juices on the plate. Pour 1/2 cup water into the mixture; bring to a boil, 
          turning the chicken to coat with the sauce. Sprinkle the garam masala and 1 
          tablespoon cilantro over the chicken. 
          
          <br>
          <br><strong>Step 4</strong>
          <br> 
          <br>Cover the skillet and simmer until the chicken breasts are no longer pink
           in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read 
           thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F 
           (74 degrees C). Sprinkle with lemon juice to serve.
