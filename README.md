Recipes Project (First project) 

This is my first main project

Everything learnt to this point in regards to HTML I will now put into practice and build 
A nice recipe website, mainly consisting of the index page (homepage) and a few links to the recipe pages.

''Itâ€™s time to put all of the HTML knowledge you have been acquiring so far into practice. In this project, you are going to build a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes''
